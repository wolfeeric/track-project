                <p>On April 18, 2017, Facebook announced React Fiber, a new core algorithm of React framework library for building
                user interfaces. React Fiber will become the foundation of any future improvements and feature development of

                <p>Rails is most commonly used with Ruby and is a Model–view–controller. An (MVC) is an architectural pattern commonly used for
                  developing user interfaces that divides an application into three interconnected parts. This is done to separate
                  internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user.
                  The MVC design pattern decouples these major components allowing for efficient code reuse and parallel development.</p>
                  <p>Although originally developed for desktop computing, MVC has been widely adopted as an architecture for World Wide Web
                    applications in major programming languages.</p>
